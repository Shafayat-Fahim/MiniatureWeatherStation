### MiniatureWeatherStation

In this repository, we will work on our Microprocessor, Interfacing and Assembly Language project, which involves constructing and running a Miniature Weather Station. This project is a **Miniature Weather Station** designed using an **ESP8266 + Mega2560 hybrid board** to collect, process, and upload environmental data to **ThingSpeak** over WiFi. It leverages multiple sensors to measure temperature, humidity, air quality (eCO‚ÇÇ and TVOC), and wind speed.

## üß† Project Objectives

- Collect real-time environmental data from surroundings.
- Transmit the data wirelessly to a cloud platform (ThingSpeak) for monitoring and visualization.
- Utilize a hybrid board to combine WiFi and sensor communication seamlessly.
- Serve as a foundational prototype for future smart agriculture, weather forecasting, or pollution monitoring systems.
